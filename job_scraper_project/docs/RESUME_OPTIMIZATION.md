## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Generic, One-Size-Fits-All Resume

**Problem**: Same resume sent to all positions
**Impact**: 70% lower response rate
**Solution**: Create 3-5 targeted resume versions for different roles
**Implementation**:
- Base template with core information
- Customizable summary and skills sections
- Reorder bullets based on job requirements
- Adjust keyword emphasis per application

### Mistake 2: Duty-Focused Instead of Achievement-Focused

**Problem**: Lists responsibilities, not accomplishments
**Impact**: Fails to differentiate from other candidates
**Solution**: Transform duties into achievements

**Transformation Examples:**

| Duty-Focused | Achievement-Focused |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Managed sales team | Led 8-person sales team to 132% of quota, highest in company history |
| Responsible for customer service | Improved customer satisfaction from 78% to 94% while reducing response time by 40% |
| Developed software applications | Built 3 full-stack applications serving 100K+ users with 99.9% uptime |

### Mistake 3: Missing Keywords for ATS

**Problem**: Resume lacks job description keywords
**Impact**: Filtered out before human review
**Solution**: Strategic keyword integration

**Process:**
1. Highlight all skills/qualifications in job description
2. Assess which you possess
3. Integrate naturally into resume
4. Use both acronyms and full terms (AWS and Amazon Web Services)

### Mistake 4: Poor Formatting

**Problem**: Difficult to scan, inconsistent formatting
**Impact**: Recruiter misses key information
**Solution**: Clean, consistent formatting

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent font (ATS-friendly: Arial, Calibri, Georgia)
- Font size: 10-12pt body, 14-16pt name
- Clear section headers (bold, larger font)
- Consistent bullet points
- Adequate white space (margins: 0.5-1 inch)
- No tables, text boxes, or graphics (except design roles)

### Mistake 5: Including Irrelevant Information

**Problem**: Resume cluttered with non-relevant details
**Impact**: Dilutes key messages, wastes valuable space
**Solution**: Ruthless relevance filtering

**Remove:**
- Outdated positions (>15 years old)
- Completely unrelated experience
- Obvious skills ("Microsoft Word")
- "References available upon request"
- Objective statements (replace with summary)
- Personal hobbies (unless directly relevant)

### Mistake 6: Typos and Grammar Errors

**Problem**: Spelling/grammar mistakes
**Impact**: 58% of resumes rejected for typos
**Solution**: Multi-layer proofreading

**Proofreading Process:**
1. Use spell-check (Grammarly, Microsoft Editor)
2. Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
3. Print and review on paper
4. Have 2-3 others review
5. Check company names and titles carefully
6. Verify dates and numbers
