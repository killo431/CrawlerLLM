## Overview

### The Purpose of a Cover Letter

A cover letter serves three primary functions:
1. **Contextualize your resume** - Explain gaps, transitions, or unique circumstances
2. **Demonstrate enthusiasm** - Show genuine interest in the specific role and company
3. **Showcase communication skills** - Prove you can write clearly and professionally

### Key Statistics

- **26%** of recruiters consider cover letters important
- **56%** of employers prefer a cover letter with every application
- **83%** of hiring managers say a great cover letter can get you an interview even if your resume isn't good enough
- **45%** will dismiss an application with a generic cover letter
- **Optimal length**: 250-400 words (3-4 paragraphs)
- **Read time**: 20-30 seconds on average

## When to Write a Cover Letter

### Always Write When:
- ✓ Job posting specifically requests one
- ✓ Applying to smaller companies (more personal)
- ✓ Career transition or employment gap to explain
- ✓ Highly competitive position
- ✓ Dream job opportunity
- ✓ Referral or connection to mention
- ✓ Need to address red flags proactively

### Optional/Skip When:
- Application system doesn't allow uploads
- Explicitly stated "no cover letters"
- High-volume application strategy
- Internal promotion or transfer
- Recruiter-initiated contact
- Time constraints with low-priority applications

### Custom vs. Template Approach

**Full Customization (30-60 minutes each):**
- Use for: Dream jobs, referrals, highly competitive roles
- Research company extensively
- Reference specific projects/initiatives
- Demonstrate deep understanding
- Expected response rate: 20-30%

**Moderate Customization (10-15 minutes each):**
- Use for: Qualified target positions
- Company-specific opening and closing
- Template middle paragraphs
- Expected response rate: 10-15%

**Light Customization (5 minutes each):**
- Use for: Volume applications
- Swap company name and role
- Generic content
- Expected response rate: 5-10%

of reducing enterprise carbon footprints is exactly the meaningful work 
I'm seeking at this stage of my career.
```

#### Closing Paragraph (2-3 sentences)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Generic, One-Size-Fits-All Letter

This position would be a great opportunity for me to learn...
```

**Why It Fails:**
