love to have a brief conversation with them about their experience.

Would you be comfortable making an introduction? I'd be happy to 
send you a blurb I can forward.

**Examples:**
- Share relevant article with commentary
- Introduce two connections who could help each other
- Congratulate on recent achievement or post
- Comment meaningfully on their content
- Offer your expertise on topic they posted about

**Then Follow With:**
```
By the way, I'm currently exploring [type of role] opportunities.

- Strong filter for relevance
- Access to exclusive networks

**Implementation:**
1. Search LinkedIn for alumni at target companies

4. Request brief phone call
5. Ask about their experience and advice

**Message Template:**
```
